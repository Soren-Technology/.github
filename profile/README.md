## 🚀 What We Do

At **Søren**, our focus is creating **full-stack websites and applications** that bring ideas to life.  
We work with clients to design and develop modern, reliable, and scalable solutions using the latest technologies.  

Alongside our client work, we also build **in-house APIs** that power tools, automation, and AI integrations.  
These APIs are the side projects that grow with us — helping push innovation forward.

## 🌍 Our Vision

Technology should feel **accessible, human, and empowering**.  
That’s why Søren is more than just websites — it’s a place where **clients, developers, and creators** can find tools that make technology work for them.
